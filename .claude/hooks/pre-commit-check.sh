# Context Guard: Pre-commit safety hook
# Reminds Claude to update safeguard files before every git commit
# Runs as a PreToolUse hook on Bash commands

# 1. SECTION: Input parsing
# Do NOT parse the hook payload with jq. jq is not present on a default Windows/Git Bash
# install, and when it is missing this line fails silently, COMMAND ends up empty, and the
# reminder below never fires, so the hook looks installed and does nothing. This reminder only
# has to spot "git commit" somewhere in the payload, which a raw substring check does without
# needing any parser at all.
